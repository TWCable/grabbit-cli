in Ready]]

== Usage

=== Prerequisites

You must first install the Grabbit AEM package on any instance you wish
to sync content to (i.e. a Grabbit client). You can download the latest
package from bintray: https://bintray.com/twcable/aem/Grabbit/view#files
See https://github.com/TWCable/grabbit[the Grabbit project page for more information].

Finally, the distributed binaries are self-executing Java programs (thanks http://www.capsule.io/[to the awesome
Capsule packager]). The only requirement is that you have the Java 7+ runtime installed.


=== Running

First, either download the binary from https://bintray.com/twcable/aem/grabbit-cli/view#files/bin , or clone this repository and build it yourself with `./gradlew`.
(The binaries will be in `build/libs/`) The file will be named `grabbit-cli-${version}` 

For the instructions below, assuming that you've renamed the binary you chose to `grabbit-cli`:

(If you downloaded the file from BinTray, you may need to set the execute bit on it first to use on a *nix system: `chmod u+x grabbit-cli`)

Run `grabbit-cli -h` to view list of options:

```shell

usage: grabbit-cli -[h|s|sm|m] [grabbit-json-file] [env-json-file] [env] [grabbit-ids-file]

  -h,--help                                                                 Show usage information
  -m,--monitor <[env-json-file] [environment] [grabbit-ids-file]>           Monitor grabbit
  -s,--start <[grabbit-json-file] [env-json-file] [environment]>            Start grabbit
  -sm,--start-monitor <[grabbit-json-file] [env-json-file] [environment]>   Start and monitor grabbit
```

Example for syncing to your local author:

```shell
grabbit-cli -sm grabbit-author.json localhost.json localhost
```

Example for syncing to your local publish:

```shell
grabbit-cli -sm grabbit-publish.json localhost.json localhost
```


[NOTE]
====
For now, check the Grabbit documentation for the format of the environment/configuration files.

There is https://github.com/TWCable/grabbit-cli/issues/7[a feature request to better document that].
